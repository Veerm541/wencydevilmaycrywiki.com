        "full": "<p>Born to the legendary dark knight Sparda and the kind-hearted human Eva, Dante was fated for greatness, though tragedy struck early in his life. His peaceful childhood was shattered when his mother was ruthlessly killed by demons, an event that also led to the mysterious disappearance of his twin brother, Vergil. Left to fend for himself, Dante developed a hardened exterior, masking his pain with arrogance, sarcasm, and an undying thirst for vengeance against the creatures that tore his family apart.</p>\n\n<p>Determined to carve out his own destiny, Dante took up the mantle of a demon hunter, establishing the now-iconic <strong>Devil May Cry</strong> business—though financial responsibility has never been his strong suit. Jobs came and went, some paying well, others leaving him completely broke, but Dante never lost sight of his true mission: safeguarding humanity from demonic threats. Whether tracking down supernatural disturbances, accepting mercenary contracts, or simply stumbling into chaos, he never backed down from a fight—even if it meant wrecking his own shop in the process.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout his journey, Dante has encountered an endless rogue’s gallery of monstrous adversaries, many of whom sought to enslave humanity or reshape the world in their twisted image. He battled and defeated the demonic ruler <strong>Mundus</strong>, avenging his mother’s death and reaffirming his position as the greatest demon slayer of his generation. He confronted <strong>Argosax the Chaos</strong>, thwarting yet another attempt to plunge the world into eternal suffering. Even when facing <strong>Urizen</strong>, a being of unimaginable strength and the dark half of his own twin brother, Dante refused to falter—proving once again that power alone is meaningless without the heart and will to wield it wisely.</p>\n\n<p>But Dante is more than just a warrior. He is the embodiment of raw style, fighting with an unmatched blend of grace, speed, and brutality, turning battles into performances worthy of standing ovations. Whether he’s flipping through the air, firing off <strong>Ebony & Ivory's</strong> explosive rounds, or swinging his <strong>Rebellion</strong> with effortless precision, Dante treats every encounter like a game—one that only he can win. His <strong>Devil Trigger</strong> unlocks the full extent of his demonic lineage, amplifying his already overwhelming power, while his varied combat styles—from <strong>Trickster’s</strong> agility to <strong>Royal Guard’s</strong> masterful defense—give him an edge that no enemy can predict.</p>\n\n<p>And yet, beneath the cocky smirk and sharp one-liners, Dante harbors deep scars from his past, wounds that no amount of demon-hunting can truly heal. Despite losing his family, he has found companionship in trusted allies such as <strong>Lady, Trish, and even finding his niece, Nero</strong>, forming bonds that remind him that even in a life filled with bloodshed, loyalty and friendship still matter.</p>\n\n<p>With every passing challenge, Dante continues to defy fate, wielding the power of <strong>Sparda</strong> while forging a legacy entirely his own. Whether standing alone against impossible odds or teaming up with unlikely allies, Dante remains the ultimate demon hunter, forever chasing the next challenge—and looking damn good doing it.</p>\n\n<p>Because when the devil cries, Dante laughs in his face.</p>",

      "lore": {
        "full": "<p>Vergil is Dante’s twin brother—equal in potential, yet profoundly different in philosophy and path. Born to the legendary demon knight Sparda and the kind human Eva, Vergil inherited the same extraordinary bloodline as Dante, but processed their shared trauma in a drastically different way. When their mother was murdered in a brutal demon attack and Vergil was separated from his brother, he was left vulnerable, alone, and consumed by a single, unwavering belief: that only through power could he protect what mattered and never be left helpless again.</p>\n\n<p>This obsession with strength became the core of Vergil’s identity. Whereas Dante embraced his humanity and the bonds that came with it, Vergil rejected vulnerability, emotion, and attachment—seeking instead to claim the full extent of his demonic heritage. His pursuit of absolute power led him down a dark and solitary road, filled with ruthless ambition and a growing disregard for anything that resembled weakness or sentimentality.</p>\n\n<p>Wielding the <strong>Yamato</strong>, a legendary katana once belonging to his father, Vergil possessed the ability to cut through space and dimensions themselves—a reflection of both his refined combat style and his desire to sever himself from human emotion. His cold, calculating demeanor masked a storm of inner conflict, as he continually sought to cast off his humanity in the belief that it held him back. This struggle culminated in a radical act of self-division: Vergil used Yamato to split himself in two, creating <strong>Urizen</strong>, the embodiment of his pure demonic will, and <strong>V</strong>, the fragment that retained his suppressed humanity and poetic soul.</p>\n\n<p>This internal war played out on a grand scale. As Urizen attempted to dominate the world through raw, unrelenting power, V sought help from Dante and Nero to bring about his other half’s downfall. Only through their combined efforts—and V’s final sacrifice—was Vergil reborn as a whole being, regaining both his immense strength and the conscience he had tried so hard to bury. This transformation marked a turning point in Vergil’s journey, forcing him to confront the consequences of his actions, his fractured identity, and the family he had long cast aside.</p>\n\n<p>Though his heart remained guarded, Vergil began to shift. His longstanding rivalry with Dante evolved from violent clashes to a reluctant, hard-earned mutual respect. He acknowledged Nero as his son—though not in so many words—planting the seeds for a tentative reconciliation that neither of them had imagined possible. Still a stoic and proud warrior, Vergil chose to stand alongside his brother and son when the world faced threats beyond even his comprehension.</p>\n\n<p>Vergil remains a figure of discipline, silence, and deadly precision. Every swing of Yamato is deliberate, every move an expression of control honed through years of isolation and hardship. But beneath the armor of power and pride lies a man shaped by grief, loss, and the desperate hope that strength could somehow bring peace. Now, with his past laid bare and his identity reclaimed, Vergil walks a new path—not one of redemption, but of resolve. No longer chasing power for its own sake, he seeks understanding of the balance between strength and compassion, between demon and human.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, Vergil’s legacy is one of transformation—a journey from isolation to uneasy brotherhood, from fragmented soul to fearsome unity. And though his battles may never truly end, he now fights not just for power, but with purpose.</p>",

      "lore": {
        "full": "<p>V is a mysterious, enigmatic figure cloaked in dark elegance and poetic melancholy. Unlike traditional warriors, V does not engage in direct combat. Instead, he relies on summoned familiars—magical extensions of his will—to fight on his behalf. This unconventional fighting style reflects his fragile physical form, which belies the immense depth and turmoil hidden within. Every word he speaks is laced with literary flair, quoting poetry as if trying to give meaning to the chaos surrounding him.</p>\n\n<p>V is not a separate entity born from chance; he is the human fragment of <strong>Vergil</strong>—the part that was discarded when Vergil used the power of <strong>Yamato</strong> to split his soul in two. While Urizen became the embodiment of Vergil’s ruthless demonic ambition, V inherited his lost humanity: the pain, the guilt, the reflection. Haunted by fragmented memories and fading strength, V embarked on a desperate journey to stop Urizen, seeking help from Dante and Nero to do what he alone could not—confront his other half and bring balance to a broken soul.</p>\n\n<p>Though physically frail, V commands three powerful familiars, each representing a different facet of his past: <strong>Griffon</strong>, a sarcastic talking bird who manipulates lightning and air; <strong>Shadow</strong>, a panther-like beast that strikes from the ground with brutal force; and <strong>Nightmare</strong>, a towering demon of raw destruction that descends like a meteor upon V’s enemies. These creatures act as both weapons and guardians, fiercely loyal to V, yet extensions of Vergil’s power and psyche.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout his journey, V wrestles not only with the danger posed by Urizen but with the fading strength of his borrowed time. His body, unstable by nature, begins to deteriorate as his human essence alone cannot sustain itself indefinitely. Despite this, he pushes forward—driven by a sense of purpose, the desire to right past wrongs, and a deep longing to become whole again. V’s character arc is one of introspection, vulnerability, and tragic beauty, standing in stark contrast to the overwhelming might of his counterparts.</p>\n\n<p>When the moment finally comes, V merges back with Urizen, reuniting the fractured soul of Vergil. Yet the mark he leaves behind is unmistakable. In his brief existence, V displayed a side of Vergil that had long been buried: compassion, remorse, and the poetic soul of a man who once loved and lost. He was not simply a tool for restoration, but a voice for the humanity Vergil tried to destroy—and perhaps, the reason he ultimately chose to embrace it once more.</p>\n\n<p>Though V’s time was fleeting, his presence was profound. He showed that strength isn’t always found in the blade or brute force, but in the quiet resilience of the heart, the pursuit of truth, and the courage to confront one's own darkness.</p>",

First introduced as a brash newcomer to the demon-hunting world, Nero quickly proved that he was more than just a hotheaded rookie—he was a force to be reckoned with. Armed with his signature weapons—the powerful <strong>Red Queen</strong>, a sword enhanced with combustion capabilities, and the custom-built revolver <strong>Blue Rose</strong>—Nero brings his own explosive and stylish flair to every battle.</p>\n\n<p>Originally a member of the Order of the Sword, Nero's life was upended when he discovered not only the dark secrets of the Order but also his own latent demonic abilities. His right arm, once infused with demonic power, was violently severed by a mysterious figure—later revealed to be his father, <strong>Vergil</strong>. In its place, Nero now wields a series of high-tech prosthetic limbs called <strong>Devil Breakers</strong>, expertly crafted by his eccentric engineer and partner, <strong>Nico</strong>. Each Devil Breaker offers a unique combat function—from explosive punches to time-slowing abilities—allowing Nero to adapt to any threat with versatility and flair.</p>\n\n<p>Though Nero’s temper and sharp tongue often get the better of him, his heart remains in the right place. He fights not for glory or power, but to defend those who cannot defend themselves. His bond with allies like Nico, his girlfriend Kyrie, and eventually even Dante grows stronger as he matures—not just as a fighter, but as a person. Beneath the bravado lies a deep vulnerability and a need to understand his place in a world that seems constantly shrouded in secrets.</p>\n\n<p>The revelation that he is the son of Vergil shook Nero to his core, challenging everything he thought he knew about himself. Yet rather than succumb to fear or anger, Nero embraced his lineage, even as he vowed to forge a different path from his father. He unlocked his true power during a climactic moment, manifesting a new demonic arm—his <strong>Devil Trigger</strong>—symbolizing his complete acceptance of who he is: not just a hunter, not just a son, but someone entirely new.</p>\n\n<p>Now standing between two legendary brothers, Nero represents the next generation of Devil Hunters—a bridge between humanity and demonkind, between past mistakes and future hope. While he still has much to learn, Nero’s courage, determination, and defiant spirit mark him as a hero in his own right. With every challenge, he grows stronger—not just in power, but in purpose.</p>\n\n<p>With Red Queen ignited, Blue Rose loaded, and a Devil Breaker armed, Nero charges headfirst into battle—not because he has to, but because it’s the right thing to do. And nothing will stop him from carving out his own legacy.</p>",

Her journey into the world of demon hunting was forged in tragedy: her father, Arkham, a once-human scholar obsessed with demonic power, murdered her mother, Kalina Ann, in a ritualistic attempt to gain such power. This act of betrayal shattered Mary's world, leading her to renounce her given name and adopt the moniker 'Lady,' symbolizing her break from the past and her resolve to forge her own destiny.</p>\n\n<p>Despite lacking any demonic heritage or supernatural abilities, Lady has proven herself a relentless and resourceful combatant. She is highly skilled in acrobatics and armed close-quarters combat, wielding an extensive arsenal of firearms with deadly precision. Her signature weapon, the <strong>Kalina Ann</strong>—a customized missile launcher named in honor of her mother—serves as both a tribute and a testament to her lethal proficiency in battle. Lady's expertise extends beyond weaponry; her deep knowledge of demon lore and tactical acumen make her an invaluable ally in the fight against demonic threats.</p>\n\n<p>Lady's path first intersected with Dante's during the events surrounding the rise of the Temen-ni-gru tower, where she sought to confront and eliminate her father. Initially at odds, Lady and Dante's relationship evolved from adversaries to allies, bonded by shared goals and mutual respect. It was Lady who inadvertently inspired the name of Dante's demon-hunting business, <strong>Devil May Cry</strong>, during a moment of shared reflection on loss and resilience.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the series, Lady has continued to play a crucial role in combating demonic forces. In <strong>Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition</strong>, she becomes a playable character, showcasing her unique combat style centered around firearms and agility. In <strong>Devil May Cry 5</strong>, she is captured and used as a vessel for the demon Artemis but is later rescued by Nero, reaffirming her enduring presence and importance within the narrative.</p>\n\n<p>Lady's character embodies the strength and determination of humanity in the face of overwhelming supernatural odds. Her evolution from a vengeance-driven lone hunter to a trusted member of Dante's inner circle highlights her resilience and capacity for growth. With each battle, Lady continues to demonstrate that true power lies not in demonic heritage but in unwavering resolve and the courage to confront one's demons—both literal and figurative.</p>",

Designed to exploit Dante's lingering grief and lure him into a deadly trap on Mallet Island, Trish initially served as a cunning agent of deception. However, her encounter with Dante would change the course of her existence. When Dante chose to save her life despite her betrayal, Trish experienced a profound awakening—one that led her to turn against her creator and stand beside the very man she was meant to destroy.</p>\n\n<p>Though born of darkness, Trish quickly proved herself to be more than a mere puppet. She possesses a formidable array of supernatural abilities, including superhuman strength, agility, and accelerated healing.

Her complex relationship with Dante is marked by mutual respect and camaraderie, with hints of deeper emotional undercurrents. Trish's presence adds a layer of sophistication and strength to the Devil May Cry universe, embodying the potential for change and the power of choice.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the series, Trish has appeared in multiple titles, including <strong>Devil May Cry 2</strong> and <strong>Devil May Cry 5</strong>, as well as various crossover games.

As the daughter of the infamous alchemist <strong>Agnus</strong> and the granddaughter of the legendary gunsmith <strong>Nell Goldstein</strong>—the creator of Dante's iconic pistols, Ebony and Ivory—Nico inherits a complex legacy of genius, ambition, and moral ambiguity. Despite her father's dark past, Nico has carved out her own identity, channeling her prodigious talents into crafting innovative weaponry to aid in the battle against demonic forces.</p>\n\n<p>Nico's partnership with <strong>Nero</strong> is both professional and deeply personal. After Nero loses his demonic arm, the Devil Bringer, Nico steps in to design and construct the <strong>Devil Breakers</strong>: a series of customizable prosthetic arms, each imbued with unique abilities tailored to Nero's combat style. These mechanical marvels not only restore Nero's fighting capabilities but also enhance them, allowing for new strategies and techniques in the field. Nico's workshop, a mobile van emblazoned with neon 'Devil May Cry' signage, serves as both a laboratory and a sanctuary, reflecting her unorthodox approach to both engineering and life.</p>\n\n<p>Personality-wise, Nico is unapologetically brash, witty, and fiercely independent. Her sharp tongue and irreverent humor often mask a deep-seated commitment to her friends and her craft. She refers to herself as the 'artisan of arms,' a title that underscores her view of weapon-making as both a science and an art form. Nico's sassy demeanor and distinctive style—complete with tattoos, red-rimmed glasses, and a perpetual cigarette—make her a standout character in the Devil May Cry universe.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond her technical prowess, Nico's character adds a fresh dynamic to the series. Her interactions with Nero reveal a layered relationship built on mutual respect, camaraderie, and a shared sense of purpose. While she often teases and challenges him, it's clear that her support is unwavering. Nico's presence brings a human touch to the supernatural battles, grounding the narrative in themes of redemption, legacy, and the enduring power of human ingenuity.</p>\n\n<p>In a world overrun by demons and dark legacies, Nico stands out as a beacon of innovation and resilience. Her contributions are not just in the weapons she crafts but in the spirit she brings to the fight—a reminder that even amidst chaos, creativity and determination can forge paths to victory.</p>",

Yet, even with this newfound power, he was ultimately bested by Dante, who had unlocked his Sin Devil Trigger form. In his final moments, Urizen merged with V, Vergil's human half, to become whole once more, acknowledging the necessity of both strength and humanity.</p>\n\n<p>Urizen's existence serves as a poignant exploration of the consequences of forsaking one's humanity in the pursuit of power.

Over two millennia ago, he served as the right-hand of Mundus, the demon emperor, participating in the invasion of the human world. However, upon witnessing the atrocities committed by his brethren, Sparda experienced a profound awakening to justice and chose to rebel against Mundus. In a monumental act of valor, he single-handedly defeated Mundus and his legions, sealing away the forces of darkness to safeguard the human realm.</p>\n\n<p>Recognizing the immense power he wielded, Sparda took a solemn vow to never allow his demonic abilities to threaten humanity again. To ensure this, he intentionally sealed away his own powers and the gateway to the Demon World, sacrificing much of his strength in the process. Despite his diminished state, he continued to live among humans, embracing a life of peace and solitude.</p>\n\n<p>During his time among humans, Sparda fell in love with a woman named Eva. Together, they had twin sons, Dante and Vergil, whom Sparda raised with love and care. Before his disappearance, he entrusted Eva with an amulet, a memento of his past, which she later passed on to their sons. This amulet would play a crucial role in the events that followed, serving as a key to unlocking the sealed gateway to the Demon World.</p>\n\n<p>Sparda's legacy endured through his sons. Dante, inheriting his father's rebellious spirit and sense of justice, became a demon hunter, protecting humanity from the very threats his father had once sealed away. Vergil, on the other hand, sought to reclaim the power his father had forsaken, leading to a complex and often adversarial relationship with Dante.</p>\n\n<p>Though Sparda's physical presence faded from the world, his influence remained ever-present. Statues in his likeness stood as monuments to his heroism, and his story was passed down through generations, inspiring countless individuals to stand against darkness. His sword, the Force Edge, and later the Devil Sword Sparda, became symbols of his enduring strength and commitment to justice.</p>\n\n<p>In the grand tapestry of the Devil May Cry saga, Sparda's actions were the catalyst for the events that followed. His rebellion against Mundus set the stage for the eternal struggle between light and darkness, a struggle that his sons would continue in their own ways. Sparda's legacy is not merely a tale of a powerful warrior, but a testament to the enduring power of choice, sacrifice, and the unwavering pursuit of justice.</p>",
